Scala Days was my first big conference talk. I've spoken at meetups and smaller venues, and even local conferences (but only with a handful of people in the room). Scala Days was a 4 track conference so I was excited to see a packed room. There was a slight hiccup with the A/V, but thanks to [@beerops](https://twitter.com/beerops) [speaking routine](https://beero.ps/2016/04/14/on-a-conference-speaking-routine/) I was prepared to give the talk from a PDF deck if necessary. (Note to future self - bring a backup [dongle](http://www.amazon.com/Moread-DisplayPort-Thunderbolt-Compatible-Adapter/dp/B00XDUIEBQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1463340443&sr=8-1&keywords=mini+display+port+dongle)).

There was a lot of great feedback from my talk. Several people from sought me out to thank me, including Martin Odersky.

#### Preparation

I had dealt with the Free Monad in a couple different production systems, but never fully understood its purpose.

I spent a while reading [academic papers](http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf) and [blog posts](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/), and watching [conference talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4956GI-6Lw) about the Free Monad. I wrote my own [blog posts](http://blog.krobinson.me/posts/explaining-monads) about the mechanics, and played around with a lot of [code](https://github.com/robinske/monad-examples).



#### The Loudest Voice in the Room

The crux of my talk focused on practicality. It was refreshing to speak with so many attendees that had felt the pain of overcomplications in Scala and wanted to write more [#blueskyscala](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6483-keynote-scaling-intelligence-moving-ideas-forward).

#### What's next

I'd like to give this talk at more conferences
