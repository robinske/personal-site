bio: Kelley has been programming in Scala since 2013, most recently managing a team of Scala developers and Data Scientists at Sharethrough in San Francisco. She is the founder of ScalaBridge, the initiative to build a more inclusive Scala community with introductory programming workshops for women. In her spare time, Kelley spends a lot of time cooking and greatly enjoys reorganizing her tiny kitchen to accommodate completely necessary small appliance purchases.
